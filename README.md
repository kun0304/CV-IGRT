# Human-Level Comparable Control Volumes Mapping with An Unsupervised-Learning Model for CT-Guided Radiotherapy

Pytorch implementation for Control Volumes Mapping with An Unsupervised-Learning Model.
The code was written by Xiaokun Liang.

## Applications
Patient Positioning in CT-Guided Radiation Therapy

## Prerequisites
Windows 10, python 3.7, NVIDIA GPU ( >= 12GB)

## Dependencies
The project depends on following libraries:
PyTorch 1.3.0  
NumPy 1.17.1  
SimpleITK 1.2.2

## Prepare data
Create a cv_dataset file with two sub-files (training and testing), and put your own data into these two files. The data folder is organized in the following way:


The CSV file is the center coordinates of the selected control volumes.
